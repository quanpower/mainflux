# Mainflux is now installed #

- Go sources are located at $GOPATH/src
- Go binaries are located are $GOBIN
- MQTT NodeJS sources are located at $PWD/mainflux/mqtt-adapter
- NGINX config files are located  in $PWD/mainflux/nginx-conf

External dependencies needed for Mainflux are:
- Cassandra
- NATS
- NGINX

NATS have been installed.
For Cassandra follow the instructions at http://cassandra.apache.org/download/
For NGINX follow the instructions here: http://nginx.org/en/docs/install.html

NGINX config has been cloned in nginx-conf,
and these config files have to be copied to /etc/nginx once NGINX server
is installed on the system.
After copying these files you have to re-start the nginx service:

sudo systemctl restart nginx.service
